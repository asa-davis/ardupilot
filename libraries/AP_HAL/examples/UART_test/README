LORD packet reader v2
=====================

On each loop:
    - read all available bytes from uart into a buffer
    - while buffer is not empty:
        a. search for header bytes 0x75 0x65
        b. peak header and parse payload size
        c. peak payload and checksum
        d. calculate checksum
        e1. if checksum incorrect:
            - go back to searching for header starting after last 0x65
        e2. if checksum correct:
            - read 2 + payload size + 2 into packet struct
            - print packet

NOTE: if we run out of bytes during a, b, or c we must save this step and return. on next loop cycle, we must resume here.

NOTE: in the future, we can make a consumer and producer thread and use a shared ring buffer with mutex/semaphore
